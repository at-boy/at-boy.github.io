Welcome to my first blog entry, well my first on this blog, I've had and been part of blogs many times but always got away from maintaining it a posting new stuff!

So this is a new attempt, the main goal of this blog is to be a place for me to document what I learn doing different projects, so what can you expect to find on this blog?

Well here is a list of topics that I'm interested in and which you may find posts about, they are in no specific order

- Dungeons & Dragons
- Computers
- Linux
- Ansible
- Security
- 3D Printing
- Model Painting (D&D stuff)
- Model Building (D&D stuff)
- Books
- Comics
- Movies
- Boardgames
- Videogames
- Hydroponics
- Electronics

This is not a complete list, a lot of other topics might come up also posts where I just ramble my thoughts about something out

Stay safe and most importantly be excellent
